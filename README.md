## Reflection

This was a contact application project built for a coding challenge using a public API. 

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to pull data from the Users API and render a visual representation of the data. I also wanted to implement a dark mode toggle to make it more visually appealing.

One of the main challenges I ran into was filtering. As I have split the data into people and companies, filtering became a little challenging. I overcame this by writing clean code with comments, ensuring there were no bugs present.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
